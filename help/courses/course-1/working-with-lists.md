## Bulleted lists

A bulleted or unordered list should be used when list components do not need to be arranged in a certain order.

### Inserting a bulleted list

1. Select the **Insert Bulleted List** icon from the toolbar.

A numbered list should be used when list components need to be ordered or structured in a certain way.

   Labels allow you to specify the version you want to include when publishing.
